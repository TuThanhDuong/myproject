There are 2 different sample datasets in myproject: Adventureworks and SQLserverdatabase. Files of which names start with either "Adventureworks" or "SQLserverdatabase" belong respectively to each dataset.

- However, all of the SQL codes, ERD uploaded in this repository are self_written and designed. My special thanks to Maz Nguyen for making this dataset open for download.
  Since I do not own this dataset, please visit Maz nguyen's blog post via the link above for a direct download if needed.
  
2. AdventureWorks_ERD is included to visualize the structure of the dummy database 

3. Data presented in Adventuresworks_topline_final is extracted by either using Excel power query/ power pivot or SQL queries results.
 
## ABOUT SQLserverdatabase
1. Credit for  this SQLserverdatabase dataset:
sqlservertutorial.net provides readers with the SQL codes to construct the sample database. The codes are available for download in the below link:
https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/load-sample-database/

2. SQLserver database diagram is also included to better visualize the structure of this sample database. I ran the SQL codes to construct the database in MySQL and use the reverse engineer feature to extract this ER diagram

3. SQLserverdatabase_Raw data.rar contains all the raw data of the database

4. 'SQL queries for Dashboard' contains the SQL codes written to extract data from the database. This extracted data then loaded to the Reference tabs_Sales and Reference tabs_Orders of the Dashboard report.
